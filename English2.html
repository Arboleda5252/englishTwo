                        regularly open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday to Friday. The library is very quiet and silent,

                    <p>Teachers, students, and staff keep busy with the different events we have during the year. Some

                    <p>
                        My favorite university event is Engineering and innovation. I like it because there are research
                        proposals from invited institutions; in addition to innovations from the region. During this
                        celebration, we have different activities for the community (students, teachers and staff keep)
                        such as: a conference on financial culture with representatives of the Banco Agrario, offers
                        from Innpulsa Colombia, exhibition of classroom projects and guided tour of the laboratories.
                        The objective of the event is to encourage more ideas in the engineering branch with new
                        projects and future endeavors.

                In conclusion, our campus is small compared to the headquarters main. But our community is very
                participatory in events and we feel like part of a family called university. Any student or teacher is
                welcome in this wonderful place.
